## Introduction ##

The purpose of this project is to have a comprehensive place to host Map/Reduce examples with related Data Sets that start out simple and then go on to more complex examples that exploit the Hadoop Map/Reduce technology.


## Getting Started ##

To start with it would make a lot of sense to have a minimal pseudo Hadoop Map/Reduce setup from which you can run simple examples, this will give you a good flavor of what Map/Reduce is and then once you are comfortable you can move on to other complex Map/Reduce examples.

### First Step ###
There is a wonderful tutorial posted by Yahoo Developer Network you can find it here
[Getting Started With Hadoop](http://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module3.html)
this is a wonderful tutorial will will get you started on your Hadoop setup on a VM Ware player **_(its important to note that you can bring multiple instances of the same image and simulate a fully distributed environment from a single machine)_**

### Further ###
Each example in the code has a detailed wiki page which has the description of what that example is about what are the Mappers and the Reducers and also the link to the data-set for download and how to run the example and how to analyze the output.
