## Motivation/Purpose ##

Hadoop Map/Reduce is gaining a lot of popularity in the industry and is having a wide range of adoption from some of the most influential as well as tech savvy companies.

One of the biggest problems i faced learning the technology was to figure out intuitive examples that i can play around with, other than the word count :).

So I am starting this project to collect real world and fun examples to learn the Hadoop Map/Reduce framework and also have links to popular data-sets that one can use to learn map/reduce programming.

Feel free to contribute your examples, so that we can all benefit from learning from examples rather than raw theory.

The emphasis is to pair examples with related Data Sets to give the impression of scale and gradually move from smaller examples to larger ones both in size and complexity.

For further help please start with the Wiki [Introduction](Introduction.md)

## How is it structured ##
The examples start really simple right now i have the [Anagram example](Anagram_Example.md) and the [Geo Location example](Wikipedia_GeoLocation.md) the objective is to start simple and then proceed to complex map reduce examples.

If you have any suggestions as to how to structure this project and also how to keep source structure classified as Simple,Complex etc and also what might be the classification of the examples category please feel free to respond
